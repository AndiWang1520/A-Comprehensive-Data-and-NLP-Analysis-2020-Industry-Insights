# A-Comprehensive-Data-and-NLP-Analysis-2020-Industry-Insights
### Introduction

Our project focused on analyzing the apparel and accessory stores industry sector, a crucial player in the global economy. This sector encompasses companies retailing clothing, shoes, and accessories, serving diverse consumer bases across geographical regions. Over the years, this industry has evolved, shaped by changing consumer preferences, economic conditions, and global trends. The analysis aimed to explore public firms within this sector through quantitative and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to uncover valuable insights.

We conducted historical trend analysis and financial performance evaluations, addressing pivotal events like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic that significantly impacted this sector. Our methodology included advanced statistical techniques, data filtering, and NLP approaches like keyword analysis and word embeddings, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the industry.

### Datasets

The **public_firms.csv** dataset provides detailed information about publicly listed companies in the United States.
The **major_groups.csv** dataset includes a list of major industry groups and their descriptions. Each entry is identified by a numeric code (major_group) and a corresponding sector name (description).
The **2020_10K_item1_full.csv** dataset features the "Item 37" sections from the 2020 10-K filings, specifically focusing on the apparel and accessory stores industry. It provides detailed textual data that can be used for natural language processing to analyze business strategies and market trends within this sector.
